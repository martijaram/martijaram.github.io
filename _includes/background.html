      I am passionate about developing for a purpose, I enjoy bridging the gap between different fields and social impact &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my passion for building stronger democracies. My goal is to always strenghten democratic processes through
      cryptography, machine learning, and quantum computing.

      or day dreaming.
